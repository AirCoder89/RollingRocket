Rolling Rocket itâ€™s one finger game play. Just press on the screen to turn the rocket engine on
and release the screen to turn it off. Easy peasy!

**Objectives:**
- Collecting coins.
- Avoid Obstacles.
- Succeed arrive to the final station.

**Features:**

Here I would like to talk about the cool things in the Game like:
- Nitro Zone: when the rocket enters in this zone the speed will increase with some blur effect
and zoom out the camera that's gives a really exciting feeling.
- Slow-Motion Zone: the opposite of nitro zone, the camera zoom in and
the rocket has the ability to avoid the convergent obstacles more easily.
- Inversion Zone: inversion everything upside down. The gravity,
the control everything behaves inverse.
- Various Obstacles: new obstacles in every
stage. And to keep the player wait discover the next new obstacles. The variation of
obstacles not just a different shape but a different behavior either.
